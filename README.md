# Medical Examination Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to visualize and analyze medical examination data to explore relationships between cardiovascular disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices. Using Python along with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we perform a series of analyses on a dataset derived from the 1994 Census database.

## Features

- Calculation of BMI and determination of overweight status.
- Normalization of cholesterol and glucose levels for analysis.
- Categorical data visualization comparing health indicators and lifestyle choices among patients.
- Data cleaning to remove unrealistic or erroneous data points.
- Correlation analysis between health indicators and lifestyle choices.

## Getting Started
